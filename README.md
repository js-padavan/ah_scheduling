ah_scheduling
=============
Building more optimised schedule with simulated annealing alghorithm
###Model:
There are a set of tasks and a set of processing devices. Each task should be process with each device 	consequentially.
Target Function is the total downtime of processing devices.
###Input:
- number of tasks
- number of processing devices
- matrix A[i][j], where each element is the processing time of i-task on j-device
